/*
When you get a prescription from a pharmacy, there is a start date associated with the 
medication. Medications also have a scheduled frequency that tells you when to take the 
doses. There are fairly common patterns for the frequencies. You can take them every 4 
hours. You can take them once a day. You can take them with meals or just before bed. 
You can also take them PRN or "as needed." Many medications also have a stop date. You may 
need to take the medication for 7 days. You may need to take a certain number of doses. 
You may also take the medication for the rest of your life. 

Assume you have to implement a system to tell nurses when a patient should receive 
medications. How would you model a schedule for a medication that handles start dates, 
end dates, and frequencies? 

Step 1: Design a class that represents a medication's schedule.
